# Rules of the Game:
## Use WASD to move the spaceship
## Watch out for the moving obstacles, you can only be hit a few times before you take too much damage
## Collect the star at the end of the level to win the game
### Hint: the walls don't damage the ship


I used some different assets from the playground than in the previous assignment because I forgot to grab assets from somewhere else until it was too late to start over. I used the movement script that we made in class for the player and created scripts for moving the blocks. I realize that I could have combined the scripts into one and just changed the constraints on the objects, but I didn't realize that until it was too late to go back and fix. It took me way too long to figure out some simple mistakes that I was making in my code. That part reminds me of working in javascript. At least Unity seems to be better about giving hints as to what the problem might be.
