I used blender for animating a project back in 2020, but haven't really done much modeling in it. So, I figured I'd model the game characters in Blender because I thought it wouldn't be too bad. The first few days were slow but I got the hang of it and modeled two enemy characters and a bunch of assets. Then, over the weekend, I made a storyboard, script, and began animating. The scene is a segment of the opening cutscene for the game. 

Note: 11/22/22 12:34 AM - The final render is still rendering. It has been running for roughly 5 hours now and is only about 1/2 way done. I didn't expect it to take this long... I just hope that the audio is synced properly, otherwise I'll have to edit the timing and render it again, also, I am just now realizing that I forgot to add text to one of the computer screens so there's that too. 

11/22/22 9:20 PM - After much trouble, I finally got the final render to finish. Brought it into premiere, mixed all of the sound effects. Moved it into After Effects, added some light and text and now it is as done as it can be at this point in time
