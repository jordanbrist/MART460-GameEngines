I have been having a lot of trouble with Unity these past two weeks. I feel like I have zero idea what I am doing...

I finally got my player to change animations and directions, but now I can't get it to jump at all, it's so frustrating because I have no idea what the problem is or could be because there are no errors and everything online is so vague. I have spent more time than I would like to admit trying to solve this. 

So, as much as it kills me, I have to submit this even though it isn't finished.
