# Rules of the Game:
## Use WASD and SPACE to control your character
## Watch out for enemies
## Collect all 5 coins to win the game

### Hint: you'll find the 5th coin afer opening the treasure chest


I used the playground assets and scripts to create a very simple platformer level. It has enemies that remove the player's health if they touch. The player starts with 3 lives and loses one each time it contacts an enemy. If the player's health drops to zero, then the game ends. There are collectibles that, once all are collected, allow the player to win the game.
